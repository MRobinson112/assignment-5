## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r assignment_5}
# Load the required libraries
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)


Flight_info <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MRobinson112/assignment-5/main/flightlab2.csv"

Airline_df <- read.csv(Flight_info, skip = 1, header = FALSE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE, na.strings = "")

# Removing blank rows
Airline_df <- Airline_df[complete.cases(Airline_df), ]

# Rename columns
colnames(Airline_df) <- c("Airlines", "Status", "Los_Angeles", "Phoenix", "San_Diego", "San_Francisco", "Seattle")

# Cleaning and transform the data
Clean_data <- Airline_df %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c(Los_Angeles, Phoenix, San_Diego, San_Francisco, Seattle),
               names_to = "Destination",
               values_to = "Delay") %>%
  filter(!is.na(Delay)) %>%
  mutate(Status = ifelse(Status == "On time", "OnTime", "Delayed"))

Clean_data

# Perform analysis
new_data <- Clean_data %>%
  group_by(Airlines, Status) %>%
  summarise(AvgDelay = mean(Delay), .groups = 'drop')
    new_data

delay_by_dest <- Clean_data %>%
  group_by(Destination, Status) %>%
  summarise(AvgDelay = mean(Delay), .groups = 'drop')
    delay_by_dest

# comparing arrival delays for the two airlines
ggplot(data = new_data, aes(x = Airlines, y = AvgDelay, fill = Status)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Arrival Delays Comparison",
       x = "Airlines",
       y = "Average Delay") +
  theme_minimal()
