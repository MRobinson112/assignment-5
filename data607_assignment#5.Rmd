# Determine the percentage of flights delay for each airline.
delay_percentages <- flight_data %>%
  group_by(Airline) %>%

    Percent_Delayed = (sum(Delayed_Arrivals) / sum(Delayed_Arrivals + One_Time_Arrivals)) * 100

# Conclusion 

Based on the summary data and the plot, it is evident that Alaska Airlines has the highest average percentage of flight delays among the airlines in the dataset.
